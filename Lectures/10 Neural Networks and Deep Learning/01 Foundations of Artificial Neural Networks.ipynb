    "- **Advanced Architectures:** Investigate **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for more complex tasks.  \n",
    "- **Optimization Techniques:** Learn about momentum-based and adaptive optimizers, such as **Adam** or **RMSProp**, to enhance training performance.  \n",
    "- **Explainable AI:** Delve into methods that make network decisions more understandable and transparent.  \n",
    "- **Ethical and Societal Implications:** As networks become more pervasive, considerations like bias, fairness, and accountability become increasingly important.\n"
